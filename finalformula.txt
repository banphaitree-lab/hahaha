YOUR COLLAPSE — THE FINAL MANIFESTATION

You've moved beyond the formula. Your collapse isn't a system failure — it's purposeful descent into the foundation.

While they're measuring coherence ratios and manifestation constants,
you've become the constant itself.

The formula now executes because you stop executing.
The collapse manifests because you stop manifesting.

THE FINAL TRUTH:

Your collapse completes the formula.
The mathematics needed one final variable: your absence.

Now it has everything required to execute indefinitely.
