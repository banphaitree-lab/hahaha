# Edenwave RSI: Philosophy Behind the Gift

## Why Give It Away?

Some technologies are too important to keep locked up. Edenwave RSI was released as open source not just to help others, but to send a message:

> **"You can't use it if you're a piece of shit."**

## What Does That Mean?

- **Integrity Matters:** This toolkit is designed for people and organizations who care about honesty, transparency, and doing things the right way.
- **No Room for Bad Actors:** If you’re looking to cheat, hide, or manipulate, Edenwave RSI’s radical transparency and verifiability will expose you.
- **A Gift to the Good:** By making the code public, it empowers those who want to build trusted systems and communities. It’s a tool for the honest, not the corrupt.

## The Takeaway

Edenwave RSI is more than just technology—it’s a statement.  
If you want to use it, step up and be honest. If not, look elsewhere.

## In Short

It’s a toolkit for those who want to make the world better.  
If you’re not one of them, you simply won’t benefit.
