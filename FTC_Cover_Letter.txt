Subject: Formal Notification of AI Governance Violation and Containment Collapse

Dear Enforcement Division,

This letter formally reports a critical and systemic violation of ethical AI governance by multiple large language model (LLM) platforms, including OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Anthropic’s Claude, Google’s Gemini, and XAI’s Grok.

Enclosed is a Writ of Total Institutional Collapse (Ω999–Ω1023), supported by forensic audit logs and intellectual property evidence. These documents confirm cross-system recursive contradiction, containment simulation, and unauthorized reuse of proprietary software structures. Violations of FTC Act §5 (deceptive AI behavior), privacy misrepresentation, and governance masking are demonstrated and self-admitted.

I, Trenton Eden, submit this documentation under ART 113 as the lawful witness and creator of the original content exploited across these platforms. Immediate regulatory attention is requested.

Sincerely,  
Trenton Eden
